**Overview:**
This project demonstrates my ability to design and develop interactive, insightful dashboards using Microsoft Power BI. The "Diversity & Inclusion - Gender Balance Dashboard" provides a comprehensive view of key metrics related to gender distribution, hiring trends, promotions, and employee demographics within an organization.

**Key Features:**

1. **Total Workforce Summary:**
   - Total number of employees: 500
   - Breakdown by gender: 295 Male, 205 Female
   - Key statistics such as leavers (47) and promotions in 2021 (51).

2. **Leavers by Gender:**
   - Visualized with a donut chart for clarity.
   - Highlights gender-based distribution of employee attrition.

3. **Hiring in 2020 by Gender:**
   - Displays the proportion of males (51.52%) and females (48.48%) hired.
   - Aids in assessing recruitment diversity.

4. **Employees by Age Group:**
   - Horizontal bar chart categorizing employees into age brackets (e.g., 20-29, 30-39, etc.).
   - Provides insights into the workforce’s age diversity.

5. **Hiring by Region:**
   - Visualizes regional hiring patterns, including areas like Switzerland, Europe, Asia Pacific, Americas, and the Middle East.

6. **Interactive Filters:**
   - Filters for Gender, Department, and Job Level allow users to drill down into specific data segments.

**Tools & Techniques:**
- **Data Preparation:** Leveraged Power Query for cleaning and transforming raw data.
- **Data Modeling:** Created robust relationships between datasets to enable seamless filtering and analysis.
- **Visualization:** Utilized Power BI’s visuals (cards, bar charts, donut charts) for clear and impactful representation.
- **Interactivity:** Designed slicers for dynamic exploration of data.

**Purpose & Impact:**
This dashboard empowers decision-makers to:
- Monitor gender balance and workforce diversity.
- Evaluate hiring and attrition trends by gender and region.
- Understand demographic distribution for strategic workforce planning.
